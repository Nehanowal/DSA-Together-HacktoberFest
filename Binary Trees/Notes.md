#### Trees 

- Recursive Data Structure

- Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially. In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size. Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.
