# Greedy algorithm :

If a problem requires either minimum or maximum result , then its a optimization problem

Optimization problems can be solved by : 
    - Greedy 
    - DP 
    - Branch and Bound

### Algorithm : 


```
Consider A = [a , b , c , d , e]

for i in range(0,n):
    x = Select(A)
    if Feasible(x) :
        Solution = Solution + x

```

Greedy Algorithm is used for selecting the best and optimal solution
